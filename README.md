**Botanical Transmissions** generates music by plants, for plants.

[Freshkills Park](http://freshkillspark.org/), formerly the world's largest landfill, is undergoing a radical transformation. Once complete, this 2,200 acre park in Staten Island will have virtually erased its 150 million tons of solid waste with a massive ecological restoration project which is open to the public.

Inspired by studies indicating that music may impact plant growth, this project takes a plant-centered design approach to the park. As a sensory experience primarily for plant life, this could serve as a symbolic repentence for human use of the area in the past.

Botanical Transmissions takes ecological data from an [Arable Pulsepod](https://www.arable.com/) and translates it into a musical composition. This is done with a genetic algorithm which automatically evolves five different traits of the music based on the plants relative health after “listening” to different compositions.

*Botantical Transmissions was designed for a project studio of the [Transdisciplinary Design MFA](https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mfa-transdisciplinary-design/) program at [Parsons School of Design](https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/) in the fall semester of 2016 by Noah Litvin, Christopher Lopez, and Tanvi Dhond in partnership with [Arable](https://www.arable.com/) and the [NYC Parks Department](https://www.nycgovparks.org/).*
